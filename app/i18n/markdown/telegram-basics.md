#### [](#q-who-can-i-write-to)Q: Who can I write to?

You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram. Another way of contacting people is to type their Telegram [username](#usernames-and-t-me) into the search field – you don't need to know their phone number to do this.

#### [](#q-who-can-contact-me)Q: Who can contact me?

People can contact you on Telegram if they **know your phone number** or if you **message them first**.

If they don't know your phone number, they can find you in these cases:

- When you both are members of the **same group**.
- If you set a [**public username**](#usernames-and-t-me). Others can use **Global Search** and find you by your username.

##### [](#q-does-telegram-send-verification-codes-for-other-apps)Q: Does Telegram send Verification Codes for other apps?

Telegram allows third-party services to [send verification codes](https://telegram.org/blog/gifts-verification-platform#verification-platform) to their users via Telegram. These codes only appear in the **verified _'Verification Codes'_ chat**, and let you tap to instantly copy the code.

[![](https://telegram.org/file/400780400405/5/DJtYqf_wYiU.829923/a5d5fc8092802cab46 "verif codes.png, 437.12KB")](https://telegram.org/file/400780400405/5/DJtYqf_wYiU.829923/a5d5fc8092802cab46)

> Services that do not specify a name or profile picture for their codes will appear with the default name and photo of _'Verification Codes'_.

If you receive a code in the _'Verification Codes'_ chat, it's probably because you requested to log in to a third-party service, like an **external website, app or marketplace**. It's also possible that someone else accidentally entered your phone number when logging in to another service. **Either way, your Telegram account is completely safe** — if you didn’t request a code, simply tap on it and select _'Report'_, no need to do anything else.

Third-party services determine which way your verification codes are sent – and Telegram is not able to control this or make a service aware of your preferences. Unlike SMS codes that frequently fail to arrive and can be interecepted, verification codes sent via Telegram are **delivered instantly** and are **securely encrypted** – making them safer and more reliable for both users and services.

The _'Verification Codes'_ chat is only used for codes from **third-party services**. Login codes for your [Telegram account](https://telegram.org/faq#getting-a-code-via-telegram) itself are sent to the **verified service notifications** chat named _'Telegram'_ in your chat list and should **never be shared** with anyone, including other services or apps.

> If you'd like to save money and increase efficiency by sending verification codes for your app or service via Telegram, check out the [Telegram Gateway](https://core.telegram.org/gateway).

#### [](#q-how-do-i-know-who-in-my-contacts-has-telegram)Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?

Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts. They also have pictures.

#### [](#q-how-do-i-invite-my-friends)Q: How do I invite my friends?

_iOS:_ The basic invitations are simple SMS messages. They will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage). Naturally, you have other options to bring your friends here. Try sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it. The link: [](https://telegram.org/dl/)**[https://telegram.org/dl/](https://telegram.org/dl/)**

_Android:_ Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) > Invite Friends. Then choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.

> You can give your friends a [t.me link](#q-how-does-t-me-work) with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.

#### [](#q-what-do-the-check-marks-mean)Q: What do the check marks mean?

_One check_ — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.  
_Two checks_ — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).

We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want. So which particular one would that check mean?

#### [](#q-can-i-hide-my-last-seen-time)Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?

You can choose who sees this info in [Privacy and Security](https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-revolution) settings.

Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own. You will, however, see an approximate last seen value. This keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram. There are four possible approximate values:

- **Last seen recently** — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days
- **Last seen within a week** — between 2-3 and seven days
- **Last seen within a month** — between 6-7 days and a month
- **Last seen a long time ago** — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)

#### [](#q-who-can-see-me-39online-39)Q: Who can see me 'online'?

The [last seen](#q-can-i-hide-my-last-seen-time) rules apply to your online status as well. People can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.

There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online. Regardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:

- Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.
- Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.
- Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.

If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online. Another way of achieving this is to block that person.

#### [](#q-can-i-delete-my-messages)Q: Can I delete my messages?

Yes. You can always delete any messages you **sent** or **received** for _both sides_ in _any_ one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only). You can also clear the entire chat history on both ends. On Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.

Together with privacy settings for [forwarded messages](https://telegram.org/blog/unsend-privacy-emoji#anonymous-forwarding), this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder). As a result, users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years. Both parties in a conversation have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.

#### [](#q-can-i-make-calls-via-telegram)Q: Can I make calls via Telegram?

Yes! You can make end-to-end encrypted [Voice Calls](https://telegram.org/blog/calls) and [Video Calls](https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls).

If you want more participants, try starting a [Voice Chat](https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats) in one of the **groups** you created. Voice Chats add a live layer of ephemeral talk to the group. They can be used as virtual office spaces for teams or informal lounges for any community. While Voice Chats are not group calls, they can achieve similar goals.

#### [](#q-how-can-i-use-emoticons)Q: How can I use emoticons?

Type **one word** in your input field to get relevant [emoji suggestions](https://t.me/TelegramTips/221). You can also type “:” followed by any keyword to open **emoji search** – like _:heart_.

You can suggest missing keywords for emoji in your language using [this interface](https://translations.telegram.org/en/emoji) (this will open suggestions for _English_, don't forget to change to your _language_ in the left menu).
