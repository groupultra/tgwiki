#### [](#q-who-can-see-my-phone-number)Q: Who can see my phone number?

On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible. By default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts. You can further modify this in _Settings > Privacy and Security > Phone Number_.

> Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and **saved** it in their address book.

#### [](#q-i-have-a-new-phone-number-what-do-i-do)Q: I have a new phone number, what do I do?

Each phone number is a **separate** account on Telegram. You have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:

- If you will **no longer use the old number** (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and [change the number](#q-how-do-i-change-my-phone-number) connected to your Telegram account to the new number. **Important:** make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.
- If you will use the new number for a **limited time** (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.
- If you want to keep using **both numbers** (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number. You _may_ create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated. It is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to **3** different [accounts](https://telegram.org/blog/autoplay#multiple-account-support) at once.

#### [](#q-how-do-i-log-out)Q: How do I log out?

Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:

- You can use Telegram on many devices **at the same time**. Just use the same phone number to log in on all devices.
- You can go to _Settings > Data and Storage > Storage Usage> Clear cache_ to **free up space** on your device without logging out.
- If you use Telegram with **multiple phone numbers**, you can [switch between accounts](https://telegram.org/blog/themes-accounts#multiple-accounts) without logging out.
- If you use Telegram on a **shared device**, you can set up a passcode in _Settings > Privacy and Security_ to make sure only you have access to your account.

If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:

_iOS_: Go to Settings > Edit > Log out.  
_Android_, _Telegram Desktop_: Go to Settings > … (in the top right corner) > Log out.

If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages. However, you **will lose** all your **Secret Chats** and **all messages** inside those secret chats when you log out.

> Note that logging out does **not** trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.

#### [](#q-how-do-i-change-my-phone-number)Q: How do I change my phone number?

You can change your number in Telegram and keep **everything**, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.

To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'. If you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to [delete](#q-how-do-i-delete-my-account) that account first.

#### [](#q-how-do-i-delete-my-account)Q: How do I delete my account?

If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the [deactivation page](https://telegram.org/deactivate). Deleting your account permanently removes all your **messages** and **contacts**. All groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.

This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.

> We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.  
> Note that you'll receive the **code** via **Telegram**, not SMS.

#### [](#q-what-happens-if-i-delete-my-account)Q: What happens if I delete my account?

As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted. That said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have _their_ copy of the messages you sent them. So if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our [self-destruct timer](#q-how-do-self-destructing-messages-work) instead.

Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible. If you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back. People, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified. The new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.

#### [](#q-how-does-account-self-destruction-work)Q: How does account self-destruction work?

Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly. If you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least 18 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.

#### [](#q-can-i-delete-my-data-without-deleting-my-account)Q: Can I delete my data without deleting my account?

You can delete most of your data without deleting your Telegram account.

To delete individual messages or entire chats for both parties at any time, simply tap on a message (or hold to select any number of chats) and tap on the delete icon, then check the option to delete for both parties.

Many relevant settings are available in _Settings > Privacy & Security_ (on iOS, there is one more step > Data Settings), for example:

- To delete your Synced Contacts, choose _Delete Synced Contacts_.
- To delete your Cloud Drafts, choose _Delete All Cloud Drafts_ (on Android, this option is in Settings > Data and Storage).
- To delete suggestion metadata about contacts and bots you message frequently, turn off _Suggest Frequent Contacts_.

#### [](#q-my-phone-was-stolen-what-do-i-do)Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?

First of all, sorry about your phone. Unfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment. We don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account. This means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.

###### [](#i-have-access-to-telegram-on-another-device)I have access to Telegram on another device

1.  Go to Telegram Settings > Privacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification. This way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.
2.  Go to Settings > Devices (or Privacy & Security > Active Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device. Whoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.
3.  Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.
4.  If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.

###### [](#i-don-39t-have-access-to-telegram-on-any-other-devices)I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices

1.  First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.
2.  Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings > Devices (or Privacy & Security > Active Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.

###### [](#removing-sensitive-data)Removing sensitive data

Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft. But if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to [log out the other device](#i-have-access-to-telegram-on-another-device), it is best that you wipe it remotely. You can read more about it here: [Apple iOS](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2701), [Android](https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager). Unfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.

You can [delete your Telegram account](#q-how-do-i-delete-my-account) if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop). Note that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 18 months being the default setting.
