#### [](#q-what-is-telegram-what-do-i-do-here)Q: What is Telegram? What do I do here?

Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use Telegram on all your devices **at the same time** — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers. Telegram is one of the **top 5 most downloaded apps** in the world with over **950 million** active users.

With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and [**files**](https://telegram.org/blog/shared-files) of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to **200,000** people or [channels](https://telegram.org/blog/channels) for broadcasting to **unlimited** audiences. You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their [**usernames**](#usernames-and-t-me). As a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs. In addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted [**voice**](https://telegram.org/blog/calls) and [**video calls**](https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls), as well as [**voice chats in groups**](https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats) for thousands of participants.

#### [](#q-how-is-telegram-different-from-whatsapp)Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?

Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with **seamless sync**. As a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to **2 GB** _each_.

Telegram needs less than **100 MB** on your device – you can keep **all your media** in the cloud without deleting things – simply [clear your cache to free up space](https://t.me/TelegramTips/206).

Thanks to Telegram's multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, it is faster and way more [secure](#security). On top of that, private messaging on Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.

Telegram's API and code is open, and developers are welcome to create their own Telegram apps. We also have a [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots), a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, [integrate any services](https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots), and even [accept payments](https://telegram.org/blog/payments) from users around the world.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

#### [](#q-who-are-the-people-behind-telegram)Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?

Telegram is supported by [Pavel Durov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov) and his brother Nikolai. Pavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological. To make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers. As a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.

#### [](#q-where-is-telegram-based)Q: Where is Telegram based?

The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.

Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St. Petersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of [highly skilled engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest#Winners). The Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore. We’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.

#### [](#q-will-you-have-ads-in-my-private-chats-and-groups-or-sell-my-da)Q: Will you have ads in my private chats and groups? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?

No. See [this post](https://t.me/durov/142) for details.

#### [](#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this)Q: How are you going to make money out of this?

We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.

Our founder and CEO [Pavel Durov](https://telegram.org/press), who financed Telegram throughout most of its history, has outlined a **strategy to make Telegram sustainable** in [this post](https://t.me/durov/142).

Following this plan, Telegram has implemented sustainable forms of monetization that prioritize its users:

- In 2021, Telegram launched [Sponsored Messages](https://t.me/durov/172) – minimalist, privacy-conscious advertisements that can appear in certain public channels.
- In 2022, Telegram launched a [Premium subscription](https://telegram.org/blog/700-million-and-premium#telegram-premium) which users can purchase to both support the app and unlock additional exclusive features.

These revenue streams help us pay for infrastructure costs and developer salaries, however making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.

> Learn more about subscriptions in the [Telegram Premium FAQ](https://telegram.org/faq_premium).

#### [](#q-what-are-your-thoughts-on-internet-privacy)Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?

We think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be:

1.  Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.
2.  Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.

Telegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, with a revolutionary [privacy policy](https://telegram.org/privacy).

#### [](#q-what-about-gdpr)Q: What about GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018. Since taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change. We don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”

Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service. For example, your cloud chats – so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts – so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram. Please see our [Privacy Policy](https://telegram.org/privacy) for more information.

You can use [**@EURegulation**](https://t.me/EURegulation) to:

- Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.
- Contact us about Data Privacy.

#### [](#q-there-39s-illegal-content-on-telegram-how-do-i-take-it-down)Q: There's illegal content on Telegram. How do I take it down?

All Telegram apps have **'Report'** buttons that let you flag illegal content for our moderators — in just a few taps.

On Telegram for Android, tap the message and select _Report_ from the menu. On iOS, press and hold the message. On Telegram Desktop, Web or Telegram for macOS, right-click the message and select _Report_. Then choose an appropriate reason.

You can also use our automated takedown email address [abuse@telegram.org](mailto:abuse@telegram.org). If you're sending an email takedown request, please make sure to include **links** (like `t.me/...` or `@...`) to the content on Telegram which you think needs attention from our moderators.

Users from the EU are welcome to study the [User Guidance for the EU Digital Services Act](https://telegram.org/tos/eu-dsa) for the relevant reporting options.

> Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact [@NoToScam](https://t.me/notoscam)

#### [](#q-how-do-i-send-a-request-under-eu-regulation-2021-784)Q: How do I send a request under EU Regulation 2021/784?

The Regulation (EU) 2021/784 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021 on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online (Terrorist Content Online Regulation, or TCO Regulation) allows authorities in EU countries to send removal requests for terrorist content, if it is discovered on Telegram's public platform. We have also designated a third party, European Digital Services Representative (EDSR), to assist us with TCO-related communications.

Users whose publications were taken down in connection with the TCO Regulation can request details on why their publications were considered terrorist and how to challenge the removal:

- by writing to EDSR at Avenue Huart Hamoir 71, 1030 Brussels, Belgium, or
- by contacting the [@EURegulation](https://t.me/EURegulation) bot on Telegram and using the command `/tco_ask`.

#### [](#q-a-bot-or-channel-is-infringing-on-my-copyright-what-do-i-do)Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright. What do I do?

**Private groups and chats** on Telegram are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them. However, Telegram also supports **sticker sets**, **bots**, **channels** and **groups** that are _publicly available_.

If you see a bot, channel, sticker set, or other content that is a part of Telegram’s public platform and is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to [dmca@telegram.org](mailto:dmca@telegram.org). Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

#### [](#q-do-you-process-take-down-requests-from-third-parties)Q: Do you process take-down requests from third parties?

Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal **public** content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, groups and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.

Public content on Telegram, such as user-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers, is not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a report regarding potentially illegal public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.

Please note that this does **not** apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech. For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders' [principles](https://mashable.com/2015/05/18/russias-mark-zuckerberg-pavel-durov/). While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.

#### [](#q-my-bot-or-sticker-set-was-banned-unfairly-what-do-i-do)Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?

If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at [abuse@telegram.org](mailto:abuse@telegram.org).

#### [](#q-do-you-process-data-requests)Q: Do you process data requests?

[Secret chats](#secret-chats) use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.

To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.

Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.

To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user messages to third parties, including governments.

> For more information on how your data is protected, please see the [Telegram Privacy Policy](https://telegram.org/privacy) and [this post](https://t.me/durov/345) by the Telegram CEO.
