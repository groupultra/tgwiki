#### [](#q-what-are-usernames-how-do-i-get-one)Q: What are usernames? How do I get one?

You can set a **public** username on Telegram. It then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username – you will appear in search under 'global results'. Please note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting a username on Telegram.

You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.

#### [](#q-what-are-collectible-usernames-how-are-they-different-from-bas)Q: What are Collectible Usernames? How are they different from basic usernames?

Collectible usernames work just like [basic usernames](#q-what-are-usernames-how-do-i-get-one), they appear in Global Search results and have their own links that can be used outside of Telegram: username.t.me and t.me/username.

They can be bought and sold through third-party platforms like [Fragment](https://fragment.com/), giving a **simple** and **secure** way to acquire and exchange valuable Telegram domains. Acquiring a collectible username gives permanent ownership, verified by the TON blockchain. Owners of collectible usernames can freely **assign them** to chats, **sell them** to others, or **keep them** for later use.

#### [](#q-how-does-t-me-work)Q: How does t.me work?

Once you've set a username, you can give people a [t.me/username](https://t.me/username) or a [username.t.me](https://username.t.me/) link. Opening either of those links on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you. You can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.

This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.

If you don’t want to set up a public username and don’t mind sharing your number, you can also create a t.me link [with your phone number](https://telegram.org/blog/downloads-attachments-streaming#phone-number-links) in **international format** – for example, **t.me/+123456789**. This type of link can quickly open a chat with you from any app, however, it will only work if your [privacy settings](#q-who-can-see-my-phone-number) let others find you by your phone number.

#### [](#q-what-can-i-use-as-my-username)Q: What can I use as my username?

You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores. Usernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g. Telegram and TeleGram is the same user).

#### [](#q-do-i-need-a-username)Q: Do I need a username?

You don't have to get one. Remember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.

#### [](#q-if-someone-finds-me-by-username-messages-and-i-reply-will-they)Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?

No. Neither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your [privacy settings](#q-who-can-see-my-phone-number)). This is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.

#### [](#q-how-do-i-delete-my-username)Q: How do I delete my username?

Go to Settings and save an empty username. This will remove your username; people will no longer be able to find you via search. This will not affect existing conversations.

#### [](#q-what-do-i-do-if-my-username-is-taken)Q: What do I do if my username is taken?

There are two types of username on Telegram, [basic usernames](#q-what-are-usernames-how-do-i-get-one) and [collectible usernames](#q-what-are-collectible-usernames-how-are-they-different-from-bas).

**Basic Usernames**

Telegram **basic** usernames are distributed on a first-come – first-serve basis.

We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us. If your desired username is already taken and it is **not registered as a collectible**, we can help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least two of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.  
To request a username, contact [@Username_bot](https://t.me/Username_bot).

**Collectible Usernames**  
If you want a collectible username but it is taken, you should check if it is available for [sale](https://fragment.com/). We cannot assign collectible usernames, they can only be managed by their **respective owners**.

#### [](#q-what-if-someone-is-pretending-to-be-me)Q: What if someone is pretending to be me?

If a scammer is pretending to be you, please contact [@NoToScam](https://t.me/notoscam).
