#### [](#q-what-makes-telegram-groups-cool)Q: What makes Telegram groups cool?

Telegram groups can have up to **200,000 members** each and are extremely powerful communication tools. Here are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world:

**Unified history**  
Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.

**Cross-platform availability**  
Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.

**Instant search**  
Find the message you're looking for, even among millions. Filter by sender to make searching easier.

**Replies, mentions, hashtags**  
Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.

**Smart notifications**  
Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.

**Pinned messages**  
You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen. All members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.

**Moderation tools**  
Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages. Define their admin privileges with granular precision.

**Group permissions**  
Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content. Or even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.

**File sharing**  
Send and receive files of any type, up to 2 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.

**Public groups**  
Get a [short link](#usernames-and-t-me) for your group and make it public, like [t.me/publictestgroup](https://t.me/publictestgroup). This way, anybody can view the group's entire chat history and join to post messages.

**Customization via bots**  
Create custom tools for any specific needs using our [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and [Inline Bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline).

#### [](#q-what-39s-the-difference-between-groups-and-channels)Q: What's the difference between groups and channels?

Telegram **groups** are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. But groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members. You can make any group **public**, toggle **persistent history** to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint **administrators** with granular privileges. You can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.

**Channels** are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences. In fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. When you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own. Each message in a channel has a **view counter** that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.
