## [Adding Image Descriptions and Sending Original Images](#adding-image-descriptions-and-sending-original-images)

When sending images on Telegram, the default format compresses the images, although the compression is relatively minor. For regular images, the impact is minimal; however, long images become nearly unreadable after compression.

- Mobile: Click on the image (instead of selecting it from the top right), and you can add a text description in the input box below. Long press the send button at the bottom right and choose `Send file` to avoid compression.

- Desktop: When sending an image, there is an input box below the image to type the text. Deselect `Image Mode` to send the image in its original file form. If you check `Remember my choice`, it will default to sending the original image next time. When the image mode is checked, you can right-click the image to add a mask effect.

## [Image Sorting](#image-sorting)

When sending multiple images on mobile, select the images from the top right, click the three dots in the top right corner, and choose `Message Preview` to reorder the images (on the desktop, you can directly drag and drop the images to sort them). If you want to send images individually rather than as a combined gallery, select `Send Without Grouping` (on desktop, uncheck `Combine Sending`).
