5.  Enter the bot name (custom) BotFather replies: `Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in 'bot'. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.`
6.  Enter the bot username (must end with "bot", e.g., `abcbot`, username cannot be changed after setting) BotFather replies (receiving the following reply indicates successful creation): `Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/abcbot....`
