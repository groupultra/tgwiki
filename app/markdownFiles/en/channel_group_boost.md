## [How to Boost](#how-to-boost)

+   The format of the boost link is `https://t.me/boost/` + `your channel/group link`.
    
+   Channel/group admins can view boost data in `More` -> `Statistics` -> `Boost`.
    
+   Only premium members (Telegram Premium) can boost.
    
+   A self-subscribed premium member has 4 boost opportunities, while a gifted premium member has 1 boost opportunity. Premium gained through giveaway events cannot be boosted.
    
+   Admins can increase boost opportunities through giveaway events. For every drawn premium membership, the channel/group will receive 4 boosts. For every 500 star coins drawn, the channel/group will receive 1 boost.
