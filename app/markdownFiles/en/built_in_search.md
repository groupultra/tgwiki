Tips

The Chinese search experience in Telegram is relatively poor. The following methods can help you find chat records and channel information faster.

- Telegram's Chinese search operates on a "phrase" basis, using punctuation marks or spaces as word separators.

  `Gu Hongming once said: True freedom does not mean being able to do whatever one wants, but rather being free to do the right things.`

  By entering in the search box: `True freedom`, `does not mean being able to do whatever one wants`, or `but rather being free to do the right things`, you can find this historical information, as punctuation marks act as word separators.

- You can also manually add extra punctuation marks (like the hashtag `#`) or spaces to segment words:

  `#GuHongming once said: True #freedom does not mean being able to do whatever one wants, but rather being free to do the right things.`

  Clicking on the following phrases, or entering in the search box: `#GuHongming`, `#freedom` can also find this sentence.

  Tips

  It is recommended that channel owners add appropriate tags with `#` when posting content to help subscribers find the information they want.

- The new version of Telegram allows you to choose the search range after clicking a tag, including: `current chat`, `chats added`, and `all chats`.
- You can also export chat records in HTML or JSON format on your computer and use other tools for more convenient searching.

## [Global Search](#global-search)

The new version of Telegram supports searching by type (e.g., `channels`, `media`, `links`, `mini-programs`, etc.).

**Global Search Tip: How to search by date?**

1.  Open the Telegram mobile home page.
2.  Click the search box.
3.  Enter a date to filter historical messages by date:
    - `2021`: Year 2021
    - `01.2021` / `Jan 2021`: January 2021
    - `01.13.2021`: January 13, 2021
