# 🔍 Telegram Built-in Search Guide

## Basic Search Techniques

### Chinese Search Mechanism
Telegram's Chinese search uses a **phrase recognition mechanism**, with punctuation or spaces serving as natural delimiters. This mechanism makes the search more flexible and accurate.

#### Example
Suppose there is a message:
> Gu Hongming once said: True freedom does not mean doing whatever one wants, but being free to do the right thing.

You can accurately find this message using any of the following phrases:
- True freedom
- Does not mean doing whatever one wants
- But being free to do the right thing

### Enhancing Search Results
You can improve the accuracy of your search by adding special tags:

#### Using Tags Example
> #GuHongming once said: True #freedom does not mean doing whatever one wants, but being free to do the right thing.

In this case, searching for `#GuHongming` or `#freedom` can quickly locate the relevant content.
