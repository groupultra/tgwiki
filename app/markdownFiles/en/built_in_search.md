Tips

The search experience in Telegram in Chinese is relatively poor, and the following methods can help you find chat records and channel information more quickly.

+   Telegram's Chinese search is based on "phrases," with punctuation or spaces acting as word boundaries.
    
    `Gu Hongming once said: True freedom does not mean doing whatever one wants, but it is the freedom to do the right thing.`
    
    You can find this historical information by entering in the search box: `True freedom`, `does not mean doing whatever one wants`, or `but it is the freedom to do the right thing`, as punctuation serves as a word separator.
    
+   You can also manually add extra punctuation (such as the hashtag `#`) or spaces to segment words:
    
    `#Gu Hongming once said: True #freedom does not mean doing whatever one wants, but it is the freedom to do the right thing.`
    
    Click on the following phrases or enter in the search box: `#Gu Hongming`, `#freedom` to find this sentence.
    
    Tips
    
    It is recommended that channel owners tag content with `#` when publishing, making it easier for subscribers to find the information they want.
    
+   The new version of Telegram allows you to select the search range after clicking on tags, including: `Current Chat`, `Saved Chats`, and `All Chats`.
    
+   You can also export chat records in HTML or JSON format on your computer, then use other tools to search more conveniently.

## [Global Search](#global-search)

The new version of Telegram supports searching by type (e.g., `Channel`, `Media`, `Links`, `Bots`, etc.).

**Global Search Tip: How to Search by Date?**

1.  Open the Telegram mobile homepage
2.  Click on the search box
3.  Enter the date to filter historical messages by date:
    +   `2021`: the year 2021
    +   `01.2021` / `Jan 2021`: January 2021
    +   `01.13.2021`: January 13, 2021
