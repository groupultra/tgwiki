## [TGwiki Document Guide](#tgwiki-document-guide)

Welcome to TGwiki! TGwiki gathers Telegram usage instructions, aiming to help users understand Telegram's various features more comprehensively. This page is the document guide for TGwiki, introducing you to some document usage tips.

The knowledge base is manually compiled, so there may inevitably be some omissions. If you find any issues, feel free to provide additions or modifications (see the "Document Maintenance" section at the bottom of this page for the process).

Tip

To better explain and demonstrate, the documents include `operation demonstrations` and `interface screenshots`. Over time, the latest interface may differ in some details. In theory, unless there are significant interface changes, the screenshots should still be applicable.

## [About Telegram](#about-telegram)

Telegram (informally referred to as TG, Telegram, or paper airplane) is a cross-platform instant messaging software. Its client is free and open-source software, while the server software is proprietary. Users can exchange encrypted and self-destructing messages, send photos, videos, and all types of files.

- High Encryption: Uses a unique network transmission protocol MTProto, immune to hacker attacks.
- No Censorship: No need to worry about account ban, unless law enforcement can prove that the user is a terrorist.
- Does Not Take Up Memory: Chat records are stored in the cloud, syncing seamlessly across any device, accessible anytime.
  
  Tip

  For information on Telegram caching and downloads, please refer to [here](tgwiki/download).
  
- Super Large Group Chats: Up to 200,000 members, equipped with various management tools (e.g., speech interval restrictions), allowing communication in large communities to be orderly.
- Emoji Stickers: High-definition vector graphics format is used, and custom stickers are supported.
- Bots: Open API interface allows developers to create their own bots.

## [Beware of Account Theft](#beware-of-account-theft)
