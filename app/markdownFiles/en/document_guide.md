## About Telegram

Telegram (informally known as TG, Telegram, Paper Plane) is a feature-rich, cross-platform instant messaging application. Its client software is free and open-source, while the server side is proprietary. Users can exchange highly encrypted messages through Telegram, including support for self-destructing messages, and can freely send photos, videos, and various files.

Its main features include:

- **High-Strength Encryption**: Employs a proprietary MTProto network protocol, effectively resisting potential network attacks.
- **Anti-Censorship Features**: Unless law enforcement can prove the user is involved in terrorist activities, user accounts are typically not subject to censorship or banning threats.
- **Cloud Storage and Synchronization**: All chat records are securely stored on cloud servers, supporting seamless synchronization across multiple devices, allowing access to your information anytime and anywhere without occupying too much local device space.

> Tip: For more information on Telegram caching and file downloads, please refer to the dedicated article [here].

- **Large Group Capacity**: A single group can accommodate up to 200,000 members. Coupled with built-in rich management tools (such as speaking interval limitations), even super-large communities can maintain an orderly communication environment.
- **High-Definition Vector Stickers**: Supports high-quality vector format stickers and allows users to create and share personalized sticker packs.
- **Powerful Bot Platform**: Provides an open API interface, empowering developers to create all kinds of powerful and interactive bots.

## Beware of Account Theft Risks

Recently, there has been a surge in account theft targeting Telegram accounts; all users must raise their vigilance.

### Important Reminders

- **Telegram officials will never actively contact your account or request information!**
- **Any request for your phone number under various pretenses is a potential account theft attempt!**
- **Do not casually download or open unknown or suspicious files sent by unfamiliar contacts!**

## Preparations Before Starting to Use

Before reading the documentation on this site, please ensure that you have installed the Telegram client application on your device and successfully registered a Telegram account.

> **Registration Tip**: Please note that the desktop or web version of Telegram does not support new user registration. You must use the Telegram client application on a mobile device (phone or tablet) to complete the account registration process.
