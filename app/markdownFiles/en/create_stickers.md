## [Create Stickers in Telegram](#create-stickers-in-telegram)

Stickers are similar to emoticons in WeChat, and Telegram supports a variety of stickers.

**The sticker management bot in Telegram is [@Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers).**

## [Create Static Stickers](#create-static-stickers)

1.  Send the command `/newpack`, wait for the bot to respond, then send the name you want for the sticker pack (supports Chinese).
2.  Upload images.

    Image format requirements: `512px` * `512px` (one side must reach 512px) supports png and webp formats, maximum supports `512px`.

    You can use Ps (Photoshop) to modify the format, and if there are too many images, you can use the batch processing tool in Ps. First record an action, then perform batch processing to solve the adaptation problems of all images at once, saving time and effort.

    Attachment: Batch Processing Tutorial

    1.  Put all the images you want to modify in a local folder.
    2.  Open the image using Ps.
    3.  Click Window - Actions, create a new action, and set the action name.
    4.  Image > Image Size, set to 512px by 512px, and click OK. If the image memory is too large, you can reduce the resolution while resizing the image to keep it under 512kb.
    5.  File - Automate - Batch, select the action you just recorded, set the source folder to where your images are stored. Click OK, and start the batch process. Wait for the entire processing to finish.

3.  Send the image to the bot, using an uncompressed image. Then send an emoji to associate the emoji with the image.

    Repeat this process until all uploads are complete. Send `/publish` to finish the upload.

4.  Set an icon for the sticker pack. The Telegram application will display it in the sticker list of the sticker panel.

    To set an icon, please send a transparent PNG or WEBP format image with dimensions of 100x100 pixels.

    You may /skip this step; the app will use the first sticker in the pack as its icon. Send `/skip` to skip.

5.  Create a share link for your stickers. After successful setup, you can share the stickers with others through this link.

In summary: This bot also allows for modifications to stickers later on; you can add, modify, delete, sort, and see the daily usage of stickers. All commands are well-documented and worth exploring.

## [Create Animated Stickers](#create-animated-stickers)

Creating animated stickers is more complex; currently, they can only be created using the command `/newvideo`.

- For the stickers, the dimensions must be exactly 512 pixelsâ€”one side can be 512 pixels or smaller.
- For emojis, the video size **must be exactly 100x100 pixels**.
- Video duration must not exceed **3 seconds**.
- The frame rate can go up to **30 FPS**.
- The video should loop for optimal user experience.
- The video size must not exceed **256 KB**.
- The video must be in WEBM format encoded using the **VP9 codec**.
- The video must **not contain an audio stream**.

Currently, you can use online websites to convert GIFs to WEBM format. If the GIF has a transparent background, the converted WEBM format emoji will also have a transparent background. Online site address: [GIF to WEBM](https://cdkm.com/cn/gif-to-webm).

When converting, set the conversion item - video size - custom, set it to 512px by 512px, and download the completed file.

The upload process is the same as described above. First, create a name for the animated sticker, upload the corresponding emoji, and set the sticker address for sharing.
