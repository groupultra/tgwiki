# Comment Feature

## How to Enable Channel Comment Functionality

Enter the channel settings and select **Channel Management → Associated Groups → Add Group** to complete the setup.

Once enabled, a "Comment" button will automatically appear below the content published in the channel, allowing users to comment on that particular message. These comments will also be synced to the associated group you have set up.

## Usage Tips

Clicking "Comment" will open a **discussion page dedicated to that message**, displaying only comments related to that specific message.

In already linked groups, if you reply to a channel message or its comments, the related discussion will also be synced to the comment section corresponding to that channel message.

Additionally, if you reply directly to a message in an associated channel's group, the system will automatically create a new discussion thread based on that message. You just need to **right-click/long press/tap** on the message to see the "x replies" prompt; clicking it will take you to the discussion area for details.
