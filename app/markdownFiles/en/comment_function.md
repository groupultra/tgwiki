Tips

Clicking on the comment will take you to a discussion group specific to the current message, which will only display comments related to that message.

If you reply to the channel message or comment message in the associated group, it will also sync and display in the discussion group for the channel message.

Additionally, in groups that are already associated with the channel, directly replying to a message will create a discussion group based on the replied message. Right-click/long press/click on the replied message to see "x Reply," and clicking will take you to the discussion group.
