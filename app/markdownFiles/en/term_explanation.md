__Definition__

__UID__

UID, or Unique Identifier, is a specific numeric code assigned to every user, group, channel, and bot, with an unchangeable characteristic. When you log out of your current account and register a new account, you will receive a new UID.

__How to find your UID?__

The official Telegram client does not currently display the UID directly. You can obtain it in the following ways:

__Using bots:__ For example, you can try interacting with \[@getidsbot\] (https://t\.me/getidsbot), \[@Sean\_Bot\](https://t\.me/Sean\_Bot), \[@userinfobot\](https://t\.me/userinfobot), or \[@username\_to\_id\_bot\](https://t\.me/username_to_id_bot) and other bots to query.

__Through third-party clients:__ Some unofficially developed Telegram clients offer features to display the UID directly. 

__Uses of UID__

Although you cannot directly search for users in Telegram using UID, in some clients, you can use the tg://user?id=UID format link to directly open the corresponding user's chat or profile page. Additionally, specific bots or userbots can perform management operations such as mute or ban based on UID.

__Username__

A username is your English identifier in Telegram, in the format of @username or https://t\.me/username, which has global uniqueness and will not be repeated.

You can set the username according to your preference or leave it blank (unset). Once a username is set, other users can easily find you through Telegram's global search feature, facilitating communication.

__Registration Time__

The official Telegram client does not display the exact registration date of the account by default. You can learn about the approximate registration time (may not be completely accurate) through the following methods:

__Using specific bots:__ For example, you can try querying with @creationdatebot or @getidsbot.

__Using third-party clients:__ Some third-party clients may provide this information. For more details about third-party clients, please refer to \[this\].

__Friends and Contacts__

__Important Concept Clarification:__ Telegram has not introduced the traditional concept or function of "friends," hence there is no such thing as "adding friends." Instead, we use "contacts," "groups," and "channels" in Telegram.

__Telegram’s Contact System:__ Contacts are divided into one-way and two-way contacts. 

__One-way addition:__ When you click on someone’s profile and select “Add Contact,” you add them to your contact list, which is considered a one-way addition.

__Two-way contacts:__ You become two-way contacts only when you add each other to your contact lists.

__Privacy Setting Reminder:__ When adding someone as a contact, __make sure to uncheck__ “Share My Phone Number.” If you do not uncheck this option, the other party will be able to see your phone number.

__Security Warning__

Please do not add strangers as contacts indiscriminately.

If you accidentally added someone as a contact and checked the share phone number option, you can revoke this sharing at any time through __Settings > Privacy > Phone Number__. For detailed steps, please refer to \[Telegram Privacy Settings\].

To easily find frequently used contacts in the future, consider adding them to your contacts list. When adding a contact, you can also modify their display name or add a note.

Please note that when you add someone to your contacts list, Telegram __will not__ send any notifications or alerts to that person; they typically won’t know that you’ve added them as a contact.

__Private Chats, Groups, Channels__

Telegram provides multiple forms of communication, mainly including: private chats, groups, channels, and bots.

__Private Chat:__

This is a way for users to communicate one-on-one, including __normal private chat__ and **Secret Chat** modes.

You can generally send a private chat to any user without having to add them as a contact first (unless the other party has set message reception restrictions).

To initiate a private chat, simply click on the other person's profile and select “Send Message.”

If you encounter a prompt saying “Currently, you can only send messages to two-way contacts,” your account may be subject to official restrictions.

You can also initiate a private chat via a user's public link or by searching their username.

For more details on Secret Chats, please refer to \[Telegram Secret Chats\].

__Group:__

Groups are chat environments that support multiple users communicating at the same time. After the group owner creates a group, other users can join and participate in discussions.

Historically, there were distinctions between “regular groups” and “supergroups,” but now the vast majority of newly created groups are supergroups, which can accommodate up to 200
