## [Conversation Groups](#对话分组)

Telegram supports grouping conversations to help users manage their conversation lists more efficiently.

Tip

Required Telegram client versions:

- iOS/Android/macOS client ≥ `6.0`
- Windows/macOS/Linux Desktop client ≥ `2.0`

## [Grouping](#分组)

You can choose which conversations and types of conversations to include or exclude, or you can combine and customize your selection of conversations.

"Archived" conversations cannot be grouped.

Each group can contain a maximum of 100 conversations, and there is no limit on pinning conversations in the group list, but a maximum of 10 groups can be created.

For example:

1. Including "Groups" means a group of all joined groups (including archived ones);
2. Including "Channels," excluding "Archived," means a group of joined channels that does not include archived channels;
3. Including "Groups," excluding "Archived and specified groups," means a group of joined groups that does not include archived ones and specified groups.

Additionally, you can create a link to share your group (private contacts, private channels, and private groups cannot be shared). Others can directly add the group by clicking the link.

Tip

The number displayed on the group represents the number of conversations with messages, not the number of unread messages.
