## Examples of Grouping

- If only "groups" is checked, the group will include all group chats you have joined (including archived ones).
- If "channels" is selected and "archived" is excluded, the group will only contain active channels.
- You can further exclude specific groups for more precise management.

## Group Sharing Feature

After creating a group, you can generate a shareable link (only applicable to public channels, groups, etc.; **not for contacts, private groups, or private channels**).

Other users can click the link to directly import the group's settings.
