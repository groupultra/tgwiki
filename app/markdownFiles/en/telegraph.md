## [Usage Tips](#使用技巧)

### [Make Article Links More Appealing](#让文章链接更美观)

Telegraph's default URL = `https://telegra.ph`/`first input title`-`first publication month`-`first publication date`

If you write a title in Chinese, for example 《选择 Telegraph 的 10 个理由》, the article link will become cumbersome and long, and the theme cannot be inferred from the link. You can achieve a more appealing Telegraph link by following these methods:

1.  For the first edit, use an English title:
    - All lowercase: `10 reasons to choose the telegraph`
    - Remove the, a, an, etc.: `10 reasons to choose telegraph`
    - Replace punctuation and spaces with hyphens: `10-reasons-to-choose-telegraph`
    - Consider simplifying or using another translation: `why-telegraph`
2.  Then use the `Edit` function to change the title to Chinese: `选择Telegraph的10个理由`

### [Make Article Formatting More Appealing](#让文章排版更美观)

1.  Write articles using Markdown, [click here to see basic Markdown syntax](https://markdown.com.cn/basic-syntax/)
2.  Copy the Markdown preview (not the source code)
3.  Paste it into `Telegraph` to quickly format a beautiful article (some formats are not supported, such as multi-level item lists)
