Tip

Note: The default shortcut list can be viewed in the shortcuts-default.json file located in the Telegram\tdata directory. Please do not modify the contents of this file. If you want to customize shortcuts, you can add them in the shortcuts-custom.json file in the same directory, and they will take effect after restarting the client.
