## Mobile

On mobile devices, Telegram supports generating QR codes for **personal accounts, groups, channels, and bots** to facilitate quick sharing of links with others. However, the official Telegram client currently does not integrate a "scan" feature.

If you want to open the corresponding content via QR code, you can use the camera app that comes with your phone to scan it. After scanning, it will automatically redirect you to the Telegram client and open the relevant chat or page.

Some third-party Telegram clients support built-in scanning functions.
