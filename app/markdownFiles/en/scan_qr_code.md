## [Telegram Scan QR Code](#telegram-scan-qrcode)

1. Telegram on mobile can generate QR codes for personal accounts, groups, channels, and bots, making it easier to share with others; however, the Telegram client does not have a built-in "scan" feature. You can use your phone's camera with the "scan" feature, which will open the link and redirect to the Telegram client to display the relevant information.
2. Some third-party clients have a "scan" feature; please refer to [Telegram Third-Party Clients](tgwiki/thirdparty) for more details.
3. On the desktop version, you can log in using the "scan QR code" method, which requires you to scan with the Telegram mobile client. The mobile client feature is located in: `Settings` -> `Devices` -> `Scan QR Code`.
